    <h2>Description : </h2>
    <p>This classic Chicken Parmesan is as good as it gets! It has a parmesan crust that seals in the juiciest chicken breast, topped with Homemade Marinara and a generous amount of melted cheese. </p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients : </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
      <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps : </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prep Marinara – If using storebought marinara, move on to step 2, otherwise, make the easy 20-minute homemade marinara. While it simmers, continue to prep the chicken.</li>
      <li>Cut 2 chicken breasts in half length-wise for 4 cutlets. Put them between plastic wrap and pound them to an even 1/3″ thickness then season with salt and pepper.</li>
      <li>Set up 3 shallow bowls: In the first bowl, combine flour, salt, and pepper, in the second bowl, beat together 2 eggs, and in the third bowl, stir together parmesan and bread crumbs</li>
      <li>Coat Chicken – Dredge chicken in flour, dusting off excess, then dip in eggs and turn to coat in bread crumbs.</li>
      <li>Saute – Once all chicken is breaded, heat a large non-stick skillet with enough oil to lightly coat the bottom and saute 3-4 minutes per side or until just cooked through at 165˚F on an instant-read thermometer. </li>
      <li>Assemble – Pour half of your marinara sauce in a casserole dish. Arrange chicken pieces over the marinara in a single layer. Spoon on marinara sauce and top with cheese then bake in a casserole dish at 425˚F for 15 minutes until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling.</li>
    </ol>
